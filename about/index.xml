We understood the hazards of working with hydrofluoric acid and nitric acids, which were the historic industry standard before we created Multi-Etch. Even relatively “safe” consumer products such as rust removers, which are sometimes used for etching titanium, contain hydrofluoric acid.
Times and regulations have changed since we first started etching titanium in 1978. During our first experiments, while preparing the hydrofluoric/nitric acid solution, orange clouds of vapor had us questioning the safety of our work environment.</description></item><item><title>The Multi-Etch Team</title><link>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/about/team/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 18:26:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/about/team/</guid><description>Chris and Sandy Boothe, founders of Multi-Etch Chris &amp;amp; Sandy Boothe # Growing up Chris always had an affinity for art and science; he’s proud to say he had a science fair project during many of his school years.
