We understood the hazards
of working with hydrofluoric acid and nitric acids, which were the historic
industry standard before we created <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span>. Even relatively “safe” consumer
products such as rust removers, which are sometimes used for etching titanium,
contain hydrofluoric acid.</p><p>Times and regulations have changed since we first started etching titanium
in 1978. During our first experiments, while preparing the hydrofluoric/nitric
acid solution, orange clouds of vapor had us questioning the safety of our work
environment. We quickly adopted some safety protocols needed to protect
ourselves: fume hood, separate air supply with a full face respirator, and air
quality monitoring with Draeger tubes. Although we took what seemed to be all
the necessary precautions, we couldn’t be confident that thirty years down the
road we might discover we had not been cautious enough.</p><p>The insidious nature of hydrofluoric acid means that if you spill some on your
body, the tissue damage may not be apparent until the next day. The
<a href=https://www.cdc.gov/>CDC</a> says, “Even small splashes of high-concentration
hydrogen fluoride products on the skin can be fatal.” Another specific danger of
etching with hydrofluoric and nitric acid, is the fluoride gas released and
without proper safety equipment you could be releasing that into the air. It’s
important to make sure your fume hood is working perfectly without a back draft.</p><p>After much research and experimentation with different solutions, we perfected
an etchant that met our exacting quality standards and is exponentially safer
than the hydrofluoric/nitric acid combination. The result was <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span>! One
key advantage of <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> is that the fluorides are bound up in the solution
and are never released as a gas. Draeger tubes read in parts per billion and the
readout was always zero! (And yes, we checked to make sure they were working).
Although the spent solutions of <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> have to be treated/neutralized before
sewering, it’s easier than dealing with hydrofluoric/nitric waste.</p><p>We have been using <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> to produce titanium jewelry and wall art for
<a href=https://www.titaniumringsforever.com/>Exotica Jewelry, Inc.</a> ever-since! After
our personal success we realized this product could be useful and help others
within the titanium jewelry industry. Then, in about 2008, different titanium
users showed up. Our largest users now are from dental, medical, aerospace,
knife making, bicycle manufacturing, and optical industries.</p><p>The efficacy of <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> is not only useful in the titanium anodizing field
but excels for welding prep and chemical milling. <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> is less aggressive
than hydrofluoric/nitric acids and can effectively remove just microns of
materials. With longer etching time, etch depth increases.</p><p><span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> is also effective on stainless steel, tool steel, brass, copper,
platinum, niobium, tantalum, and zirconium. <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> interacts differently
with various metals, please be sure to check our <a href=/etch-rates>etch rates</a> for
your desired results.</p></article></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer text-muted"><div class=container><p class="m-0 text-center">© 2022, All Rights Reserved, <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span>, LLC</p></div></footer><script zgotmplz src=/multietch-dev/js/bootstrap.6d0fe66deb0188911601a1dc40599ac7b6b8b81d88d0fa19931f32485e5c6534.js integrity="sha256-bQ/mbesBiJEWAaHcQFmax7a4uB2I0PoZkx8ySF5cZTQ="></script><script zgotmplz src=/multietch-dev/js/app.026e544890cb210a1a9769b9d8131e4b382549410a93ee67a30fe568972cec41.js integrity="sha256-Am5USJDLIQoal2m52BMeSzglSUEKk+5now/laJcs7EE="></script></body></html>
