metal you’re etching) collect in your bath. When you accumulate too much metal,
it will start to plate back on to your workpiece and inhibit good color in
titanium.</p><p>And unfortunately, <strong>pH is <em>not</em> helpful in determining when the bath is
spent</strong>. pH does gradually becomes more acidic as the etchant ages, whether or
not it has been used.</p><h4 id=so-how-can-you-tell-when-the-etchant-is-spent>So, how can you tell when the etchant is spent? <a href=#so-how-can-you-tell-when-the-etchant-is-spent class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><p>The short answer is that the etchant is still working if you’re able to get good
color. As the etchant gets used, you may find that longer etching times lengthen
the lifespan of the etch bath.</p><p>For titanium, we have a rough guide that <strong>a gallon of regular-strength
<span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> will clean approximately 1,500 square inches of titanium</strong> when
dipped for three seconds at 120–160°F.</p><p>Other metals, and doing more substantial etching such as preparing for welding,
will consume <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> at different rates. Read on for how best to determine
this.</p><h3 id=tips-for-consistent-etch-times>Tips for consistent etch times <a href=#tips-for-consistent-etch-times class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>If you are working on one-offs or something special, it&rsquo;s best to use fresh
etchant. But if you need to etch with used etchant, first check for good color
by etching and anodizing some scrap metal of the same type/alloy as your
workpiece.</p><h4 id=large-scale-etching>Large-scale etching <a href=#large-scale-etching class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><p>If you work with gallons of etchant at a time with lots of similarly-sized
parts, you want to spend the time to determine the quantity of parts you can
regularly etch before the etchant is spent. This will require some &ldquo;sacrificial&rdquo;
parts at least toward the end of your initial bath&rsquo;s lifespan.</p><p>Once you’ve determined how much you can etch before you no longer get good
color, you might want to back off by 5% or so with all subsequent etching baths
to make sure there’s never any bad anodizing.</p><p>This is especially true for dental and medical implants, when protocol prohibits
removing &ldquo;bad&rdquo; anodizing and redoing it.</p><h4 id=cutting-etch-baths>Cutting etch baths <a href=#cutting-etch-baths class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><p><strong>Another option is to make periodic cuts of the etch tank and replace the cut
volume with fresh etchant.</strong></p><p>As an example, were you to estimate an etch life of four weeks, instead of
dropping the etch tank and making up a fresh batch every four weeks, it would be
better to cut the etch tank by ¼ every week then make it up with fresh
chemistry. Maintaining the etch this way, each week you would begin with roughly
the same etch as any other week.</p><h3 id=etch-rates-by-metal-and-purpose>Etch rates by metal and purpose <a href=#etch-rates-by-metal-and-purpose class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>Be sure to check out our <strong><a href=/etch-rates/>etch rates by metal</a></strong>, which list
rates by alloy, purpose (anodizing, welding, etc.) and whether <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> is
