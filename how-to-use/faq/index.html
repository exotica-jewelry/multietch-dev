120–160°F. As you etch, the etchant gradually becomes ineffective and
contaminated with titanium ions that can re-plate to the metal, causing uneven
anodizing.</p><h4 id=how-do-i-know-when-the-multi-etch-solution-is-used-up>How do I know when the <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> solution is used up? <a href=#how-do-i-know-when-the-multi-etch-solution-is-used-up class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><p>The short answer is that the etchant is still working if you’re able to get good
color. If you are working on one-offs or something special it’s best to use
fresh etchant. But if you need to etch with used etchant, first check for good
color by etching and anodizing some titanium scrap of the same type/alloy as
your workpiece.</p><p><strong>For more details, see our

leaving the rest unadulterated.</p><h4 id=what-should-i-use-to-hold-the-piece-i-am-etching>What should I use to hold the piece I am etching? <a href=#what-should-i-use-to-hold-the-piece-i-am-etching class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><p>Use titanium or niobium wire bent around the piece to be anodized, or strung
through a hole in the piece. You can also make plastic holders by drilling holes
in plastics marked 5 or some marked 7. Affix a handle if you want or suspend the
holder from a wire made of titanium or niobium.</p><h4 id=how-do-i-dispose-of-spent-multi-etch>How do I dispose of spent <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span>? <a href=#how-do-i-dispose-of-spent-multi-etch class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><p>This varies based on federal, state, and local wastewater regulations, but is
generally much easier than disposing of hydrofluoric acid. Consult a wastewater
expert where you live to determine what is allowed, or
<strong><a href=/disposal/>read our disposal page</a></strong> for details.</p><h3 id=troubleshooting-with-multi-etch>Troubleshooting with <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> <a href=#troubleshooting-with-multi-etch class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><h4 id=why-am-i-not-getting-any-color-on-my-etched-titanium>Why am I not getting any color on my etched titanium? <a href=#why-am-i-not-getting-any-color-on-my-etched-titanium class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><p>If there isn’t any change in color, check your connections.

techniques to anodize since the 1970s, sometimes we still get our wires crossed!</p><h4 id=why-is-the-anodized-color-on-my-titanium-pieces-splotchy-in-places>Why is the anodized color on my titanium pieces splotchy in places? <a href=#why-is-the-anodized-color-on-my-titanium-pieces-splotchy-in-places class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><ol><li><p>Did you <strong>mix the entire amount of <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> powder</strong>?</p><p>The ingredients in <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> are not blended, so you must mix the entire

must heat the entire solution one time</strong>, 120–160°F — then you can use
it right away or wait for it to cool to room temperature, 70°F.</p><p>Make sure you mix double strength (<span class="frac frac--entity">&#189;</span> gallon distilled or deionized water)
and shake the container before heating.</p><p>Also be sure to watch our video
<strong><a href=/how-to-use/videos-resources/#room-temperature-multi-etch>Using <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> Unheated</a></strong>.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you have <strong>de-greased the metal</strong> before etching.</p><p>If the metal is really dirty, e.g., after tumbling, etch once, rinse well,
and etch again. Hold the pieces by the edges so that you don’t leave
fingerprints.</p></li><li><p>Did you accidentally <strong>contaminate your etching bath</strong>?</p><p>If you introduce brass, copper or iron into the etching bath, those materials
will tend to plate onto the titanium and interfere with anodizing. If that
happens, you will need to throw out your contaminated etching bath and start
with a fresh one. These contaminants could come from the tooling you use to
form your piece — files, saws, etc.</p><p>If possible, keep a separate set of tools or clean the piece with an
ultrasonic bath before etching.</p></li><li><p>What are you <strong>holding the titanium with while anodizing</strong>?</p><p>Using something other than titanium or niobium as hanging/holding wires when
anodizing can prevent the voltage getting to the titanium. Some metals, such
as copper, brass, gold, etc. will draw off the voltage.</p><p>Some people use a plastic container with a titanium or niobium probe to
anodize — this works great for anodizing lots of small parts.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you <strong>rinse well</strong> after etching the metal.</p><p>If you drag <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span> into your anodizing bath, it can inhibit good color.
If you are not going to anodize immediately after etching, protect the clean
surface by applying a 10-volt color.</p><p>If you don’t want to anodize at all, then store the etched pieces in
distilled water. This will allow you to wait months, if necessary, before
anodizing.</p></li><li><p><strong>What alloy and form of titanium</strong> are you using?</p><p>Our experience is mostly with grades 1 and 2 “commercially pure” titanium
sheet and wire. Sometimes the ends of a batch of wire or sheet have a heat
oxide that is very hard to remove. You also can’t see it! But if you suspect
that might be the problem because most of the pieces in a batch anodize fine,
try etching the “bad” pieces longer and avoid using the high-voltage colors
if possible.</p><p>The aircraft grade — <span class="frac frac--formatted">6&frasl;4</span> — usually colors well with minimal etching.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cast titanium parts</strong> like medical implants sometimes have a whitish
alpha-case from heat which must be mechanically removed (e.g., sand-blasting)
If this is not removed, it may be difficult or impossible to anodize evenly
with higher voltage colors.</p><p>Try etching longer before anodizing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grow the oxide slowly.</strong></p><p>For instance, if you’re aiming for the color at 70 volts, start at 60 and,
while leaving the piece in your anodizing bath, keep the voltage at 60 and
see if the color continues to advance to the higher voltage color. If it
doesn’t, try increasing the voltage slowly.</p></li><li><p><strong>What is your anodizing solution?</strong></p><p>We use 1 tablespoon of ammonium sulfate per gallon of distilled water. You
can get ammonium sulfate wherever gardening supplies are sold. You can also
use
<a href=https://www.reactivemetals.com/patinas-chemicals><strong>TSP-PF Electrolyte</strong></a>.</p><p>Start with <span class="frac frac--entity">&#8539;</span> cup per gallon of distilled water. If the anodizing reaction
is too slow, add a little more TSP. For a bath of either ammonium sulfate or
TSP, you can squirt a little dish detergent or Simple Green to act as a
surfactant, which is important when you are after a smooth gradation from
one color to another. Without that, sometimes the liquid “beads up” when
lifting the titanium out of the bath.</p><p>If burning or pitting occurs while anodizing, particularly at higher
voltages, then the electrolyte has been mixed too strong. <strong>DO NOT ANODIZE</strong>
with <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span>, sulfuric acid, or detergents with fancy spot retardants.</p></li><li><p>It’s possible that <strong>if you purchased distilled water in a plastic jug</strong>
that has been sitting around the store awhile, the water may have absorbed
something from the plastic jug itself. Try using water from a purified-water
vending machines.</p></li><li><p>Poor color can be a sign that <strong>you haven’t etched long enough</strong> or you have
<strong>used up the etchant</strong> and need to replace the bath.</p><p><strong><a href=/how-to-use/get-consistent-etch-times/>Read our guide on keeping etch times consistent with <span class=multietch-wordmark>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class=registered>&#174;</span></span></a></strong>.</p></li><li><p>If you wire-brushed the metal or used other steel tools, make sure you have
thoroughly <strong>cleaned any contaminants</strong> from the pieces before etching.</p></li></ol><hr><p><strong>Sometimes everything is “correct”</strong> but you still can’t get even color in the
higher voltages. This can be due to inconsistencies on the metal itself.</p><p>High-voltage colors are the hardest colors to achieve, so if you have a choice,
choose a lower voltage color, especially for the problem pieces.</p><h2 id=still-have-questions>Still have questions? <a href=#still-have-questions class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>You can post in our
