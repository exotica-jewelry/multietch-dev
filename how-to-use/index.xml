When you accumulate too much metal, it will start to plate back on to your workpiece and inhibit good color in titanium.
And unfortunately, pH is not helpful in determining when the bath is spent. pH does gradually becomes more acidic as the etchant ages, whether or not it has been used.</description></item><item><title>Removing anodized color with Multi-Etch</title><link>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/how-to-use/removing-color/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 15:24:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/how-to-use/removing-color/</guid><description>In addition to using Multi-Etch to prepare reactive metals like titanium and niobium for anodizing, you can use Multi-Etch to remove existing anodized colors from the metals.
Removing color from titanium # After anodizing, the left half of this piece was covered with tape. The whole piece was then dipped in Multi-Etch to remove the color on the right half. Removing color with Multi-Etch works much faster when the Multi-Etch is heated to 150–160°F.</description></item><item><title>Preparing for welding with Multi-Etch</title><link>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/how-to-use/welding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 14:58:37 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/how-to-use/welding/</guid><description>A welder using Multi-Etch to prepare a titanium bicycle frame, courtesy Firefly Bicycles. Multi-Etch can be used to prepare titanium and other metals for welding.
It’s a good idea to test using scrap material of the pieces that will be welded so you can determine your exact etching time.
Using heated Multi-Etch # We recommend using Multi-Etch heated to 150°F, as it works much faster than room-temperature solution.
Read our setup and basic step-by-step instructions for using Multi-Etch&amp;nbsp;→ In preparing metals for welding, your etch time will be longer than it would be for anodizing.</description></item><item><title>How to use heated Multi-Etch</title><link>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/how-to-use/heated/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 14:15:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/how-to-use/heated/</guid><description>We recommend using your Multi-Etch heated because it’s MUCH faster.
Your first order will come in a jug with the Multi-Etch powder at the bottom. This container can be used to dissolve and mix your Multi-Etch for your first and future orders. Store and use Multi-Etch in plastic containers, never in metal or glass.
Subsequent orders will come in a bag with just the Multi-Etch Powder. Because the ingredients are not blended, you must mix the entire package.</description></item><item><title>How to use room-temperature Multi-Etch</title><link>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/how-to-use/room-temperature/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 14:15:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://exotica-jewelry.github.io/multietch-dev/how-to-use/room-temperature/</guid><description>We recommend using your Multi-Etch heated because it’s MUCH faster — typically 7–15 seconds. When using it at room temperature (70°F), etching time will initially be 2+ MINUTES but will speed up the older the bath is. In a one-year old bath your etching time would be reduced to about one minute.
