# Development site for https://multietch.com

Multi-Etch is created with the static site generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).
This repo also uses Node with yarn for some helper scripts, so everything
Hugo-related is in the `hugo` directory.

## Editing site variables

- `hugo/config/_default/config.toml` (main configuration)

## Hugo modules

The site imports components like the theme as
[Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) rather than as git submodules
(as in the past).
[More information about this approach.](https://github.com/rootwork/hugo-module-site)

The `go.mod` file is in the `hugo` directory of the repository, and modules are
loaded in `hugo/config/_default/config.toml`.

## Editing the theme

Customizing a theme is done by
[overriding theme files](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/theme-components/).
Because themes are loaded dynamically using Hugo modules, go to the themes'
original repos to see what files to override and their initial content.

Add notes at the top of any overridden files using Go comments (`{{/* */}}`) to
note what has been changed -- this vastly eases integrating new changes to the
overridden files from upstream.

## Fresh installation

### Hugo

- Check version: `hugo version`
- `sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/hugo`
- Get the `hugo_extended_VERSION_OS-64bit.*`

  (e.g. `hugo_extended_0.81.0_Linux-64bit.deb`) and install.

### Hugo modules

- Update all modules: `hugo mod get -u`
- Update all modules recursively: `hugo mod get -u ./...`
- Update a single module: `hugo mod get -u <repo_path>`
- Update a single module to a specific branch:
  `hugo mod get <repo_path>@<branch>`
- Update a single module to a specific version (tag
  [must use semver](https://go.dev/doc/modules/version-numbers)):
  `hugo mod get <repo_path>@<git_tag>`
