##### Multi-Etch was originally developed for use on titanium, and is a perfect low acid (pH 6.8) alternative to hazardous hydrofluoric (HF) acid

**How much titanium will one gallon of Multi-Etch etch?** Approximately 1,500
square inches of titanium when dipped for three seconds at 120–150°F. As you
etch, the etchant gradually becomes ineffective and contaminated with titanium
ions that can re-plate to the metal, causing uneven anodizing.

**Etch times shown in the charts below are guidelines.** Etch times can vary
depending on the freshness of the etch bath.

**Surface finish** — whether polished, matte, etc. — will be maintained as long
as the etch time is less than 20 seconds. Longer etch times will tend to change
polished finishes to matte. After 5 minutes, the finish starts to trend to
semi-polished.

**Titanium with mill oxides**, which are hard to see, may require longer etching
times. For many small parts, use a tumbler with ceramic media moistened with
double strength Multi-Etch; tumble for approximately 15 minutes.
