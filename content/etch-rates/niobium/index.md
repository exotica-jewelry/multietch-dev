### Preparing niobium for anodizing using <span class='multietch-wordmark'>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class='registered'>&#174;</span></span>{.subheading}

Not usually necessary. Sometimes niobium arrives with mill oxides which are hard
to see and may require etching to get good color. For many small parts, use a
tumbler with ceramic media moistened with double strength Multi-Etch and tumble
for approximately 15 minutes.
