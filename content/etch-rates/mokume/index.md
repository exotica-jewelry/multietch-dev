##### Different etch rates of metals used in mokume accounts for the pattern enhancement.

**Titanium-niobium mokume** needs only anodization preparation and then
anodizing will bring out the patterns, as any given voltage level will produce
two different colors on the two metals.

Etching also works well with **copper-based mokume**. Multi-Etch will not etch
precious metals.
