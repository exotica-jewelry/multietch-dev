### Preparing tantalum for anodizing using <span class='multietch-wordmark'>Multi&#8209;Etch<span class='registered'>&#174;</span></span> {.subheading}

Not usually necessary. Sometimes tantalum arrives with mill oxides which are
hard to see and may require etching to get good color. For many small parts, use
a tumbler with ceramic media moistened with double strength Multi-Etch; tumble
for approximately 15 minutes.
