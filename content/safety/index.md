- Rubber gloves
- Safety goggles
- Fume hood for venting

We also recommend **protective clothing** as Multi-Etch **will** bleach your
clothes.

## Multi-Etch Safety Data Sheets (SDS)

## Hydrofluoric acid vs. Multi-Etch

**If Multi-Etch splashes on your skin, you can simply rinse it off with no ill
effects.** If you get hydrofluoric acid on your skin, you want to get medical
attention quickly or risk significant tissue damage, even if you rinse it right
away: HF is an insidious toxin that continues deep into your body hours and even
days after you think you've taken care of it sufficiently.

Here is one report on the seriousness of exposure to hydrofluoric acid:
[**Hydrofluoric Acid Accident**](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/chem/HFfatality.php).

A major difference between Multi-Etch and hydrofluoric acid is that the fluoride
in Multi-Etch is always bound up in solution; **it is never released into the
air**. With hydrofluoric acid, fluoride is out-gassed continuously and it's wise
to take air quality samples to make sure the fume hood has no back-draft.

**The active ingredient in some consumer rust removers is hydrofluoric acid**;
if you use one of those products, treat it as an extremely hazardous material.

**We'd like to see hydrofluoric use reduced as much as possible in order to
provide better safety for employees and a safer environment for us all. See
[WarOnHF.com](https://waronhf.com) for more.**

## Disposal of used Multi-Etch

As we say in the safety data sheet (SDS), Multi-Etch users must comply with all
federal, state, and local wastewater regulations. But how can you find out what
is allowed? The best way is to check with the wastewater manager of your town
and provide them with the [SDS](#multi-etch-safety-data-sheets-sds).
