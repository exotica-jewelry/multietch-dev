Join others in the **dental, medical, jewelry, aerospace, and consumer product
industries** who have switched from using dangerous acids like Hydrofluoric, or
never wanted those hazards in their work life in the first place and chose the
safe route for etching titanium and other metals.

The danger of working with **hydrofluoric acid** has been in the news lately
following the huge explosion at an oil refinery in Philadelphia. A Reuters.com
article reports:

> “A source familiar with plant operations said one explosion occurred at the
> 30,000 bpd alkylation unit that uses hydrofluoric acid (HF), one of the
> deadliest chemicals in the refining business and a source of controversy for
> its use to make high-octane gasoline at refineries located in densely
> populated areas.
>
> “Hydrofluoric acid can form a toxic cloud at room temperature, with exposure
> leading to severe health problems and even death.”
