title: 'Disposing of used Multi-Etch'
description:
  'Disposal of spent Multi-Etch varies depending on your local regulations. We
  are aware of larger companies using many gallons of Multi-Etch per week who
  are allowed to neutralize their waste etchant and sewer it with lots of water
  but they may have a special permit.'

As we say in the [safety data sheet (SDS)](/safety/#sds), Multi-Etch users must
comply with all federal, state, and local wastewater regulations. But how can
you find out what is allowed? The best way is to check with the wastewater
manager of your town and provide them with the [SDS](/safety/#sds).

**Consult the wastewater expert where you live to determine what is allowed, and
check back here for updates.**
