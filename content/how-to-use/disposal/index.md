  'Disposal of spent Multi-Etch varies depending on your local regulations. We
  are aware of larger companies using many gallons of Multi-Etch per week who
  are allowed to neutralize their waste etchant and sewer it with lots of water
  but they may have a special permit.'

As we say in the [safety data sheet (SDS)](/safety/#sds), Multi-Etch users must
comply with all federal, state, and local wastewater regulations. But how can
you find out what is allowed? The best way is to check with the wastewater
manager of your town and provide them with the [SDS](/safety/#sds).

We are in the process of determining how those regulations might vary in
different localities—sometimes local regulations are more stringent than Federal
rules. We will update this page and [blog](/blog/) about it when we have details
to share.

We are aware of larger companies using many gallons of Multi-Etch per week who
are allowed to neutralize their waste etchant and sewer it with lots of water
but they may have a special permit. We know baking soda is often used to
neutralize Multi-Etch but we don’t know what other regulations apply.

**Consult the wastewater expert where you live to determine what is allowed, and
check back here for updates.**
