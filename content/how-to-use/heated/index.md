We recommend using your Multi-Etch heated because it’s MUCH faster.

Your first order will come in a jug with the Multi-Etch powder at the bottom. This container can be used to dissolve and mix your Multi-Etch for your first and future orders. Store and use Multi-Etch in plastic containers, never in metal or glass.

Subsequent orders will come in a bag with just the Multi-Etch Powder. Because the ingredients are not blended, you must mix the entire package.

### Step 1: Equipment setup

Arrange your etching equipment near your fume hood. Here's one possible setup:

#### Simple double boilers

Alternatively, you can use simple double boilers (see images below). For the inner container that holds the Multi-Etch, use plastics marked 5 or sometimes 7 that can withstand the heat. The outer container that just holds water can be made of metal or ceramic. But **NEVER USE METAL OR GLASS FOR THE INNER CONTAINER THAT HOLDS THE MULTI-ETCH** because metal and glass will both etch slowly and the glass will eventually break.

Inner containers made of plastics marked 5 or 7 should be OK sitting right on the bottom of the outer container but if you want to be extra cautious, line the bottom of the outer container with pebbles or some kind of baffling screen.

### Step 2: Safety gear

Once the setup is complete, you can put on your protective gear: Safety goggles, gloves and a lab coat!

### Step 3: Prepare Multi-Etch

Prepare your Multi-Etch for use. Add water with the help of a funnel.

For regular strength, you will add one gallon of de-ionized or distilled water; for double strength, add 1/2 gallon.

Shake vigorously and leave overnight, or, if using sooner, shake again right before use.

### Step 4: Heat Multi-Etch

{{< img src="double-boiler-fume-hood.jpg" alt="Double boiler placed beneath a fume hood in laboratory" align="right" >}}

At this stage turn on your fume hood.

Pour into a double boiler only as much Multi-Etch as you need for this session, keeping the rest capped in the bottle. Heat until you see fine bubbles, or the temperature of Multi-Etch is 125–150°F.

While waiting for the Multi-Etch solution to reach desired temperature, clean your titanium parts with Simple Green.

### Step 5: Etch your metal

{{< img src="anodizer-with-bath.jpg" alt="Anodizing machine set-up next to a bucket of clear liquid labeled anodizing bath" align="left" >}}

Swish or swirl your titanium pieces in Multi-Etch for 7–10 seconds. If your holder will touch the heated Multi-Etch, make sure it’s made of plastic, titanium, or niobium.

Rinse in distilled or de-ionized water.

Anodize right away or store in distilled or de-ionized water to prevent re-formation of the natural oxide layer.
