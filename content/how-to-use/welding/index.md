Multi-Etch can be used to prepare titanium and other metals for welding.

It’s a good idea to test using scrap material of the pieces that will be welded
so you can determine your exact etching time.

### Using heated Multi-Etch

We recommend using Multi-Etch heated to 150°F, as it works much faster than
room-temperature solution.

In preparing metals for welding, your etch time will be longer than it would be
for anodizing. The length of time will vary from **10 to 90 seconds** but
depends on how much material you want to remove.

### Using room-temperature Multi-Etch

If you can’t use Multi-Etch hot for your application, Multi-Etch can be used at
room temperature (70°F) using 1/2 gallon or less de-ionized or distilled water.
The entire bath must be heated one time.

Initial etch time can vary but will probably be at least 10 minutes, depending
on how much material you want to remove.

## Reusing Multi-Etch

If you reuse etchant until it is spent, etch time using either method will
likely need to be increased, because the etchant will slowly become saturated
with titanium molecules.
