## Etch safely with Multi-Etch

Our detailed instructions are aimed at small users trying out titanium etching and anodizing for the first time. But the principles are the same for larger users with a dedicated production line, similar to those made by [IPEC Global](http://ipecglobal.com).

1. **Mix the Multi‑Etch:** Shipped to you as a dry powder for ease of storage.
   Just add water!

2. **Etch titanium or [other metals](/etch-rates/):** Just 7–10 seconds for titanium in heated Multi‑Etch does the job.

3. **Enjoy clean, bright titanium:** Get brilliant colors anodizing as usual, or begin welding.

### Heated or room temperature solution?

Multi-Etch can be used while heated (125&#8211;150°F) or at room temperature (70°F). **Heated Multi-Etch will act much more quickly.**

You can [download a Multi-Etch Data Sheet (PDF)](/files/s/20-0165-Multietch-data-sheet-111920.pdf) with an overview of the product, and browse our [frequently asked questions and troubleshooting process](/faq).

### Using Multi-Etch for more than anodizing

The most common use of Multi-Etch is preparing titanium for anodizing, but it can be used on [a variety of metals](/etch-rates/) for many uses:

* [Using Multi-Etch to prepare titanium for welding](/welding)
* [Removing anodized color from titanium, niobium and more](/removing-color)
* [Removing drill bits from gold](/etching-gold-multietch)

### Disposal

When finished with your batch, we have a guide on [**disposing Multi-Etch safely**](/disposal).
