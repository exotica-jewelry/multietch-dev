We recommend using your [Multi-Etch heated](/how-to-use/heated/) because it’s
MUCH faster — typically 7–15 seconds. When using it at room temperature (70°F),
etching time will initially be 2+ MINUTES but will speed up the older the bath
is. In a one-year old bath your etching time would be reduced to about one
minute.

Your first order will come in a jug with the Multi-Etch powder at the bottom.
This container can be used to dissolve and mix your Multi-Etch for your first
and future orders. Store and use Multi-Etch in plastic containers, never in
metal or glass.

Subsequent orders will come in a bag with just the Multi-Etch Powder. Because
the ingredients are not blended, you must mix the entire package.

### Step 1: Equipment setup

**In order to use Multi-Etch at room temperature — 70°F — the etch bath must be
mixed double strength and heated one time.** You can do this in a crock pot or a
simple double boiler. Then the etchant can be used right away and at room
temperature after it cools.

When heating the Multi-Etch, use proper indoor ventilation or do it outdoors.
Here's one possible setup:

#### Simple double boilers

Alternatively, you can use simple double boilers (see images below). For the
inner container that holds the Multi-Etch, use plastics marked 5 or sometimes 7
that can withstand the heat. The outer container that just holds water can be
made of metal or ceramic. But **NEVER USE METAL OR GLASS FOR THE INNER CONTAINER
THAT HOLDS THE MULTI-ETCH** because metal and glass will both etch slowly and
the glass will eventually break.

Inner containers made of plastics marked 5 or 7 should be OK sitting right on
the bottom of the outer container but if you want to be extra cautious, line the
bottom of the outer container with pebbles or some kind of baffling screen.

### Step 2: Safety gear

Once the setup is complete, you can put on your protective gear: Safety goggles,
gloves and a lab coat!

### Step 3: Prepare Multi-Etch {.clear}

Mark the jug "double strength." With the help of a funnel, pour 1/2 gallon of
distilled or deionized water into the jug. Shake vigorously and pour the entire
1/2 gallon into the inner container of the double boiler.

{{</ grid >}}

Fill the outer container of the double boiler with tap water so that the water
level is below the lip of the inner container.

### Step 4: Heat Multi-Etch {.clear}

{{< img src="double-boiler-fume-hood.jpg" alt="Double boiler placed beneath a fume hood in laboratory" align="left" >}}

If using a fume hood, turn it on.

Heat the Multi-Etch to 150°F; use a probe thermometer or, if unavailable, look
for the tiny bubbles to appear and then continue heating for about 10 minutes.

While waiting for the Multi-Etch solution to reach the desired temperature,
clean your titanium parts with Simple Green.

### Step 5: Etch your metal {.clear}

{{< img src="anodizer-with-bath.jpg" alt="Anodizing machine set-up next to a bucket of clear liquid labeled anodizing bath" align="right" >}}

Rinse and submerge your titanium piece in the Multi-Etch bath.

- If the bath is still hot, submerge for 10 seconds.
- If the bath has cooled to room temperature, submerge for at least 2 minutes.

Rinse in distilled or de-ionized water.

Anodize right away, or store in distilled or de-ionized water to prevent
re-formation of the natural oxide layer. If the color is unsatisfactory, etch
for a longer time.
