In addition to using Multi-Etch to prepare reactive metals like titanium and
niobium for anodizing, you can use Multi-Etch to remove existing anodized colors
from the metals.

## Removing color from titanium

Removing color with Multi-Etch works much faster when the
[Multi-Etch is heated](/how-to-use/heated/) to 150–160°F.

### Reverse-anodizing colors

If you simply went past the target color, you can dip the piece in heated
Multi-Etch and it will work backward through the colors.

**Be sure to rinse as soon as you see the color you want.**

### Removing all anodized color

If the color is uneven and you want to start over, etch time will be longer than
when you etched the raw metal. Just keep etching until the color disappears.

Etch times for erasing high voltage colors will be longer than erasing low
voltage colors:

- For regular-strength [heated Multi-Etch](/how-to-use/heated/), removing high
  voltage colors will take between 30 seconds and 2 minutes.

- For double strength
  [room temperature Multi-Etch](/how-to-use/room-temperature/), erasing high
  voltage colors will take 6 to 40 minutes depending on the titanium grade. See
  the [titanium etch rates page](/etch-rates/titanium/) for specific times. The
  time can be reduced in unused double-strength solution that is at least
  several months old.

## Removing color from niobium

In [heated Multi-Etch](/how-to-use/heated/), erasing high-voltage colors will
take about 4.5 minutes for regular strength and about 3.5 minutes for
double-strength. See the [niobium etch rates page](/etch-rates/niobium/) for
details.

[Room temperature Multi-Etch](/how-to-use/room-temperature/), even if it has
been heated one time, will take days to remove color from niobium.

## Removing color from zirconium

In [heated Multi-Etch](/how-to-use/heated/), erasing high voltage colors will
take about 3 minutes in double strength solution. See the
[zirconium etch rates page](/etch-rates/zirconium/) for details.

## Removing color from tantalum

In [heated Multi-Etch](/how-to-use/heated/), erasing high voltage colors will
take about an hour in double strength solution. See the
[tantalum etch rates page](/etch-rates/tantalum/) for details.
